# -InternIntelligence_Machine_Learning_Model_Development

Libraries used:
	•	pandas (for analyzing, exploring, and manipulating data)
	•	scikit-learn (for encoding and training data)
	•	panel (for the user interface)

I built a machine learning model for car price prediction using a dataset from Kaggle, which was scraped from turbo.az. The dataset consists of 10,000 rows and 6 columns. Additionally, I added a new column named ‘brand’ using Excel.
