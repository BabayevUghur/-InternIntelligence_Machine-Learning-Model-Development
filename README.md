Libraries used: pandas(analyzing, exploring, and manipulating), scikit-learn(encoding and training data), panel(user interface)

I built a ml model on car price prediction from the dataset I got from Kaggle which was scraped from turbo.az that consists of 10k rows and 6 columns, I added a new column which is named 'brand' using Excel.
